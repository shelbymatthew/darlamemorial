All visitors will be asked to maintain social distancing and wear a mask.  Darla will be cremated, and her ashes spread amongst her favorite places.  
        Darla was born in Pittsburg, KS on January 12, 1958.  She graduated from Putnam City West HS in Oklahoma City, OK.

She was involved in cub scouts, little league, and active in her church and PTO.<br /> <br /> 
        Darla is preceded in death by her mother, Norma June Kemp-Buck, and her nephew Chance Quintero.<br /><br />
